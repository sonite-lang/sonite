# Phase 4 — Compiler & Language Stabilisation

Before adding major new features, make the language you already have reliable.

### Compiler correctness

* [x] Parser edge cases (existing suite + fuzz / invalid-input stability)

* [x] Structured compiler diagnostics
* [x] Source spans on all major errors
* [x] Error codes
* [x] Helpful error messages
* [x] Suggestions where practical (high-confidence “did you mean?”)

* [x] Compiler frontend fuzzing (`pnpm test:fuzz` / `test:fuzz:long`)
* [x] Crash regression fixtures (`packages/compiler/tests/crash-regressions/`)

### Cross-platform

* [x] Linux x64 / ARM64, macOS x64 / ARM64, Windows x64 — covered by existing Phase 1 CI (`native-toolchain.yml`)

### Deferred from Phase 4

Runtime stress and sanitizer work is tracked separately below so Phase 4 can close on compiler product gaps without blocking on a distinct engineering effort.

```

on:

```text id="y1b39k"
Linux
macOS
```

and:

```text id="3v6x6s"
Windows debugger tooling
```

where appropriate.

* [x] LLDB via lldb-dap (bundled from LLVM SDK when available)
* [x] Sonite frame filtering (hide runtime/async internals by default)

The Sonite developer should interact with the Sonite debugger rather than needing to understand native debugger internals.

### Crash reporting

* [x] Runtime crash signal handlers with last Sonite frame
* [x] `sn crash list` / `sn crash show` / `sn crash clean`
